# API Documentation

Welcome to the API documentation for our project! This documentation provides detailed information about the available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements for our API.

## Accessing the Documentation

To access the API documentation, navigate to the `/api/docs` route on our server (either on your local development server or on a deployed server, e.g., https://lapp.fly.dev/api/docs). This route serves the Swagger documentation, which offers a comprehensive overview of our API endpoints.

## Exploring the Documentation

Once you access the `/api/docs` route, you'll be presented with the Swagger documentation interface. This interface allows you to explore and understand our API by providing detailed endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, and other relevant information.

Please note that the "Try it out" feature is disabled for our API documentation. Our API is specifically designed for internal usage within our application, and it is not intended for integration into other projects or external services.

Feel free to refer to the documentation to understand the available endpoints and how to interact with our API within our application.
