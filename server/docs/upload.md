To check more configuration of file upload using multer check more in [here](/server/src/config/upload.ts)

Current configuration:

File allowed: `"pdf", "png", "doc", "docx", "jpg", "jpeg", "svg", "gif"`

`filePath` (the folder `name` that will upload to the firebase cloud storage)

`uploadLimit` (the variable that limit in multer upload middleware)
